# News_Recommendation-System | OpenAI API, Embeddings, Scipy,Flask, Docker
  In this project I have:
- Used OpenAI embeddings to convert text into vectors and compute cosine similarity for ranking 
  articles by relevance
- Built a Flask UI for users to input queries and receive real-time, personalized article 
  recommendations.
- Deployed the application on Docker, using a Dockerfile for containerization and easy scalability
